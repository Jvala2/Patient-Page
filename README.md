This was my first real world challenge. My first foray into designing something for someone outside of a class assignment.

This was built as an attempt to make a database retrieving software without using MYSQL, because as of the time of writing this, my class has only just begun to cover MYSQL. As a result this runs on an Express javascript server locally hosted, with object oriented programming.

This is capable of pushing a series of strings of user entered information into a backend server side array using frontend commands.

In the process of building this I was able to learn a lot about object oriented programming, considering that this is one of my first times using it. I also learned that I am insanely lucky and did not get hit by a bolt of lightning ten feet away from me during an electrical storm. Also I learned a lot about Murphy's Law.
